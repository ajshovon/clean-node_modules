# Clean Node Modules

A command-line tool that will be written in Go that recursively finds and removes `node_modules` directories to free up disk space.

## Planned Features

- Recursively scan directories for `node_modules` folders
- Delete found `node_modules` directories safely
- Show space reclaimed after cleanup
- Command-line interface for easy usage
